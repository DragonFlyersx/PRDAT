Error:
The error is that the queue keeps a permanent dummy field that points to the
original first node, even after that node has been dequeued. The original first
node's next chain still references all enqueued nodes, so they remain reachable
and can't be garbage-collected.

Fix:
This can be fixed by removing the dummy field entirely and instead initialize
the head and tail to the same new sentinel node.

We also found another small fix, that could increase the efficiency of the
garbage collector by setting first.next to null after updating the value of
head resulting in us not keeping a long chain of nodes.
